Hi, my name is Micah. I'm a computer science student and aspiring software engineer who wants to create technology that feels like the magic I read about all the time in my favorite fantasy novels. One of my favorite quotes is from Arthur C. Clarke: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

To start off the new year, I decided to create this blog. I believe forcing myself to write about ideas I find interesting will improve both my communication ability as well as my thought process. By having an outlet to express my thoughts, I can better engage in learning and self-reflection.

My hope is for this blog to be a catalyst for growth in 2026. Here's to a new year.
