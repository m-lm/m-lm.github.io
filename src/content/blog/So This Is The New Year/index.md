Hey there, my name is Micah. I'm a computer science student and aspiring software engineer that wants to create technology that feels like the magic I read about all the time in my favorite fantasy novels. One of my favorite quotes is from Arthur C. Clarke: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

To start off the new year, I decided to create this blog for three reasons. First, I believe forcing myself to journal will improve my writing ability by discussing ideas that I find interesting. Second, by having an outlet to express my thoughts, I can better engage in self-reflection and learning. Finally, this blog can serve as a great historical repository for what I have learned over time.

My hope is for this blog to be a catalyst for growth in 2026. Here's to a new year.
