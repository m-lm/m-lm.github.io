Hey, my name is Micah. I'm a computer science student and aspiring software developer who wants to create technology that feels like the magic I read about all the time in my favorite fantasy novels. One of my favorite quotes is from Arthur C. Clarke: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

To start off the new year, I decided to create this blog. Hopefully, I learn something along the way.
