            Hey, I'm Micah, a computer science student.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my free time, I enjoy both listening and making music. I produce guitar- and synth-based electronic music, a hobby I have been cultivating on and off for the past decade or so. I also take up piano.
            <br>
            <br>
            I also love to read books, both fiction and nonfiction, 
            but my favorite genre is fantasy and my favorite authors at the moment are Robert Jordan, Mark Lawrence, and Brandon Sanderson.
